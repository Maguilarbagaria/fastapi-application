# fastapi-application

### This API application is the result of the 19h course "Python API Development - Comprehensive Course for Beginners" by freecodecamp.

From their [web](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/creating-apis-with-python-free-19-hour-course/):

_A lot of API tutorials just teach the absolute minimum. But a production-ready API is much more complicated than what most tutorials teach. We just published a massive 19-hour course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a full-fledged API using Python and the FastAPI library_
### Sanjeev Thiyagarajan developed this course. Sanjeev is a great teacher and really knows how to break things down for beginners.

***
The API built in this course is for a `social-media-type application` where users can `create/read/delete/update posts as well as like other users posts`.  It includes `user registration and authentication`.

First you will learn learn the fundamentals of API design including routes, serialization/deserialization, schema validation, and models. You will also learn about how to setup and use SQL databases.

Then you will learn how to integrate the API with the database using both raw SQL queries and with the SqlAlchemy ORM. Postgres is used as the database but everything you learn will be applicable almost any other SQL database.

Next you will learn how to set up testing for the application using the pytest library. You'll setup a test database and perform a good number of integration tests.

After creating the API, you will learn how to deploy the API using two different methods. The first is to deploy on an Ubuntu machine and the second is to deploy to Heroku. You will even learn how to dockerize the application.

Finally you will learn how to build out a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub actions.
